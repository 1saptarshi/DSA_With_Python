# Union of Two Sorted Arrays

# âœ… Approach: Two Pointer Algorithm
# Since the arrays are already sorted, use two pointers to iterate through both.

# Compare elements at both pointers.

# Add the smaller one to the result if it hasn't already been added (to ensure uniqueness).

# If both are equal, add one and move both pointers.

# Skip duplicates as you go.
